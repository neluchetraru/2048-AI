# 2048-AI

Only the logic.py was taken from an external repository: https://github.com/yangshun/2048-python .
We only used the logic from the library to use the game engine and display the boad. Anything related to AI was implement by us.

Instructions:

Simply run the main. In the directory "python ./main.py"
