# 2048-AI

Only the logic.py was taken from an external repository: https://github.com/yangshun/2048-python .
We only used the logic from the library to use the game engine and display the boad. Anything related to AI was implement by us.

Instructions:

Simply run the main and declar the depth. In the directory "python ./main.py 'depth'"
The depths we tested were 3 and 5.

Example:

python ./main.py 3
